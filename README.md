This project was developed for the ME4014 - Introduction to Gas Dynamics course project. It is written in MATLAB. To use it, simply set the desired gamma value (specific heat ratio) and the Ma₁ range within the script. The code will then automatically calculate the normal shock wave parameters and generate the corresponding table and figures.

How to Use

----Open the .m file in MATLAB.
----Set the gamma variable to your desired value.
----Define the Ma1​ range using Ma_1_start and Ma_1_end.
----Run the script.
